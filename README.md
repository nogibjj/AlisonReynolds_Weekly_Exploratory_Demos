# Weekly Exploratory Demos
This repository will hold my weekly demos for exploring rust and cloud computing.

## Week 2
random: In week 2 I created a command line tool that interacts with the rand crate. There are two functions: coin, which returns the output of a coin flip (heads if the random boolean output is 1, tails otherwise) and coin_n, which takes a integer input n and flips that many coins, returning the proportion of heads. The commands are flip for the single coin flip and flip-n for multiple coin flips. I also implemented two tests, one for each of the functions.

## Week 2
plotting: In week 3 I create a plotting function that generates two vectors with 100 random values between -100 and 100 and plots them on a scatter plot. It then saves the scatter plot to a .png file that can be viewed. This function uses the plotters crate to generate the plot and the rand crate to generate the vectors. After saving the plot, it prints "Plot finished" so the user knows that the plot is ready to be viewed.
