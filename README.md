# Weekly Exploratory Demos
This repository will hold my weekly demos for exploring rust and cloud computing.

## Week 2
random: In week 2 I created a command line tool that interacts with the rand crate. There are two functions: coin, which returns the output of a coin flip (heads if the random boolean output is 1, tails otherwise) and coin_n, which takes a integer input n and flips that many coins, returning the proportion of heads. The commands are flip for the single coin flip and flip-n for multiple coin flips. I also implemented two tests, one for each of the functions.
